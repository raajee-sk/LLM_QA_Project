# Question-and-Answer-System-Using-LLM-PROJECT-REPORT
Develop an intelligent question-answering system that can  answer questions based on
given code basic dataset. The system should utilize large language models (LLMs) to effectively 
process and understand the context of both the dataset and the question, enabling it to generate comprehensive 
and relevant answers. The system should be able to handle a variety of question types, including open-ended,
challenging, and strange questions. Additionally, the system should provide evidence from the dataset to support 
its answers, enhancing the transparency and credibility of its responses.
